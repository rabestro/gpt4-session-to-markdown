Advantages:\n   - They allow you to run the same test multiple times with different input values, which can help reduce code duplication.\n   - They can make your test suite more concise and easier to maintain.\n   - They can help you cover a wide range of input values and edge cases with a single test method.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - They can be harder to read and understand, especially if there are many input parameters or complex data structures.\n   - Debugging can be more challenging since you need to identify which specific input values caused the test to fail.\n   - They may not be suitable for all scenarios, especially if the test logic varies significantly between different input values.\n\nOrdinary tests:\n1. Advantages:\n   - They are straightforward to write, read, and understand.\n   - Debugging is generally easier since each test method is independent and focused on a specific scenario.\n   - They can be more flexible, allowing you to write custom test logic for each scenario.\n\n2. Disadvantages:\n   - They can lead to code duplication if you need to test the same functionality with multiple input values.\n   - They can make your test suite longer and harder to maintain if you have many similar test methods.\n\nIn summary, parameterized tests are a great choice when you need to test the same functionality with multiple input values, and the test logic is consistent across those values. Ordinary tests are better suited for scenarios where the test logic varies significantly between different input values or when the test cases are easier to understand and maintain as separate methods.\n\nFor the given problem, since we have multiple test cases with different input trees and expected results, using parameterized tests would be a good choice to reduce code duplication and make the test suite more concise. However, if you prefer ordinary tests, I can generate the test code accordingly. Please let me know your preference.",

The `@CsvSource` annotation now uses the specified delimiter `|` and a text block for the input data. The test method `maxPathSum` takes the tree as a string and converts it to a `TreeNode` object using a custom `fromString` method (not shown here).\n\nPlease note that this approach requires a custom method to convert the string representation of the tree to a `TreeNode` object. If you need help implementing this method, please let me know.\n\nI hope this updated test code meets your initial requirements.

          "content": "Using a `fromString` method with `@CsvSource` can be justified in certain situations, but it has some trade-offs compared to using `@MethodSource`. Here are some points to consider:\n\nAdvantages of using `fromString` with `@CsvSource`:\n1. The test cases are more compact and easier to read in the `@CsvSource` text block.\n2. It can be more convenient to represent trees as strings when writing test cases.\n\nDisadvantages of using `fromString` with `@CsvSource`:\n1. The string representation of the tree may not be as clear and intuitive as the `TreeNode` constructor calls used in `@MethodSource`.\n2. The `fromString` method assumes a valid input string and may require additional error handling and validation checks.\n3. Debugging test cases can be more challenging since you need to convert the string representation back to the tree structure to understand the test case.\n\nIn the case of the `maxPathSum` test, using `@MethodSource` with explicit `TreeNode` constructor calls provides a clearer representation of the tree structure and makes it easier to understand the test cases. However, if you prefer a more compact representation of the test cases and are willing to handle the trade-offs mentioned above, using `fromString` with `@CsvSource` can be a viable option.\n\nIn summary, both approaches have their pros and cons, and the choice depends on your specific requirements and preferences.
