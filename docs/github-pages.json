The default value is `true`.\n\nExample `_config.yml` configuration for the Minimal theme:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: \"My Minimal Site\"\ndescription: \"A clean and simple Jekyll theme\"\ntheme: \"jekyll-theme-minimal\"\ngoogle_analytics: \"UA-00000000-0\"\nshow_downloads: true\n```\n\nYou can also customize the theme's style by overriding the default CSS. You can do this by creating a file called `assets/css/style.scss` in your site's root directory with the following content:\n\n```scss\n---\n---\n@import \"{{ site.theme }}\";\n// Your custom styles go here\n```\n\nMore information about the Minimal theme can be found in the GitHub repository:\n[https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)\n\nAdditionally, you can still configure the standard Jekyll options, like `author`, `url`, `baseurl`, and others, as described in the Jekyll documentation:\n[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/)",

The `repository` option is used to specify your GitHub repository's path as a string, using the format `username/repo-name`. This is particularly useful when you want to show the \"Fork me on GitHub\" ribbon or a \"View on GitHub\" link.\n\nHere's an example of how you can include the `repository` option in your `_config.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: \"My Minimal Site\"\ndescription: \"A clean and simple Jekyll theme\"\ntheme: \"jekyll-theme-minimal\"\nrepository: \"yourusername/your-repo-name\"\n```\n\nBy specifying the `repository`, you can then use the `site.github` metadata in your theme's templates to display information related to the repository, like linking to the repository home page or showing download links. This is facilitated by the `jekyll-github-metadata` plugin which is already enabled by default on GitHub Pages.\n\nFor more details on using repository metadata, you can refer to the `jekyll-github-metadata` plugin documentation:\n[https://jekyll.github.io/github-metadata/](https://jekyll.github.io/github-metadata/)",

For example:\n\n```\n{{ site.author.name }}\n{{ site.author.email }}\n{{ site.author.bio }}\n```\n\nNote that these sub-options are common and not specifically tied to any theme. They may or may not be utilized depending on the theme or template you're using. You can adjust your templates or choose a theme that supports these sub-options to display this information on your site.",
